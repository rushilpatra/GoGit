Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
ANS)

-> SSH keys helps us to avoid writing username and password every single time when you push any change to github and authenticate it.
-> SSH (Secure Shell) is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data.

->SSH keys are more difficult to hack than passwords and thus are more secure.
